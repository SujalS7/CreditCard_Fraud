# CreditCard_Fraud
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. Since fraud cases are rare compared to normal transactions, imbalanced data handling techniques like SMOTE were used to improve fraud detection accuracy.

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools:
Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), Seaborn, Matplotlib

Model Persistence: Joblib


ðŸ“Š Dataset:
The dataset consists of credit card transactions, labeled as fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

Due to class imbalance, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to balance the data.
